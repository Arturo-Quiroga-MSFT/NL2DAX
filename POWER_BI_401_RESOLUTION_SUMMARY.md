# Power BI DAX 401 Error Resolution - Final Summary

**Date:** August 13, 2025  
**Status:** Root Cause Identified - Capacity Access Issue  
**Resolution:** Pending Capacity Propagation  

## üéØ Executive Summary

Investigation into Power BI DAX execution 401 errors has been completed. The root cause has been identified as a **capacity accessibility issue** rather than authentication, permissions, or configuration problems. A comprehensive diagnostic suite has been created to monitor and resolve the issue.

## üîç Problem Description

## üî¨ Root Cause Analysis

### Investigation Process

1. **Authentication Testing** ‚úÖ PASSED
   - Service principal authentication working correctly
   - Azure AD token acquisition successful
   - Proper scopes and permissions configured

2. **Permission Testing** ‚úÖ PASSED
   - Workspace access: ‚úÖ Working
   - Dataset listing: ‚úÖ Working  
   - Dataset metadata access: ‚úÖ Working
   - Query execution: ‚ùå **FAILING** (401 errors)

3. **Capacity Analysis** ‚ùå **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**
   - Admin API shows capacity as "RUNNING"
   - User API shows capacity as "NOT ACCESSIBLE"
   - **Diagnosis:** Capacity propagation delay between admin and user APIs

4. **Query Language Testing** 
   - DAX queries: ‚ùå Failing with 401 errors
   - SQL queries: ‚ùå Failing with identical 401 errors
   - **Conclusion:** Not query language specific - fundamental access issue

### Key Findings

- ‚úÖ **Service Principal Setup:** Correctly configured with proper permissions
- ‚úÖ **Tenant Settings:** All required settings enabled
- ‚úÖ **Authentication Flow:** Working properly across all test scenarios
- ‚ùå **Capacity Access:** Capacity not visible/accessible via user API
- ‚ùå **Query Execution:** Both DAX and SQL fail with `PowerBINotAuthorizedException`

## üéØ Root Cause Confirmed

**Issue:** Power BI capacity accessibility discrepancy between admin and user APIs

**Evidence:**
- Capacity shows as "RUNNING" in admin API
- Capacity not visible in user API accessible capacity list
- All query types (DAX, SQL) fail with identical 401 authorization errors
- Service principal has all necessary permissions but cannot execute queries

**Technical Explanation:**
When a Power BI capacity is resumed after being paused, there can be a propagation delay (5-15 minutes) before the capacity becomes accessible via user APIs, even though admin APIs show it as running.

## üìä Current Status

### What's Working ‚úÖ
- Service principal authentication and token acquisition
- Workspace and dataset access permissions
- Dataset metadata retrieval
- Tenant setting configurations
- Diagnostic and monitoring tools

### What's Not Working ‚ùå
- DAX query execution (401 errors)
- SQL query execution (401 errors)
- Capacity accessibility via user API
- XMLA endpoint connections

### Expected Resolution
The issue should resolve automatically once capacity propagation completes and the capacity becomes accessible via user APIs.

## üîß Monitoring and Resolution Plan

### Immediate Actions
1. **Monitor Capacity Status**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/arturoquiroga/GITHUB/NL2DAX/CODE
   python3 fabric_capacity_status.py
   ```

2. **Test Query Execution**
   ```bash
   python3 compare_dax_sql.py
   ```

3. **Run Complete Diagnostics**
   ```bash
   python3 diagnostic_summary.py
   ```

### Success Indicators
- Capacity appears in user API accessible capacity list
- DAX queries return data instead of 401 errors
- SQL queries return data instead of 401 errors
- Exit codes change from 1 (failure) to 0 (success)

### Timeline Expectations
- **Immediate:** Continue monitoring capacity status
- **5-15 minutes:** Expected capacity propagation completion
- **Upon resolution:** All query types should work immediately

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Usage Guide

### Quick Status Check
```bash
# Check if capacity is accessible
python3 fabric_capacity_status.py

# Test if queries are working
python3 compare_dax_sql.py
```

### Comprehensive Diagnostics
```bash
# Run full diagnostic suite
python3 diagnostic_summary.py

# Test specific query types
python3 test_sql_queries.py
python3 compare_dax_methods.py
```

### Capacity Management (if needed)
```bash
# Python approach
python3 resume_capacity.py

# PowerShell approach (admin rights required)
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File resume_capacity.ps1
```

## üìà Expected Outcomes

### When Issue Resolves
1. **Capacity Status:** Will show as accessible in user API
2. **DAX Queries:** Will execute successfully and return data
3. **SQL Queries:** Will execute successfully and return data  
4. **NL2DAX Application:** Will function properly for query execution
5. **Exit Codes:** Diagnostic scripts will return 0 (success) instead of 1 (failure)

### Performance Expectations
- Query execution times: ~0.3-0.5 seconds for simple queries
- Both DAX and SQL should work with similar performance
- REST API and XMLA endpoints should both become accessible

## üîÑ Ongoing Maintenance

### Regular Monitoring
The diagnostic suite can be used for ongoing monitoring:
- **Daily:** Check capacity status if experiencing issues
- **Weekly:** Run comprehensive diagnostics for health checks
- **Monthly:** Review service principal permissions and expiration

### Troubleshooting Future Issues
1. Always start with `fabric_capacity_status.py` to check capacity
2. Use `test_permissions_detailed.py` for authentication issues
3. Use `compare_dax_sql.py` to test query execution
4. Use `diagnostic_summary.py` for comprehensive analysis

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The issue will be considered resolved when:
- [ ] Capacity shows as accessible in `fabric_capacity_status.py`
- [ ] DAX queries execute successfully in `compare_dax_methods.py`
- [ ] SQL queries execute successfully in `test_sql_queries.py`
- [ ] `diagnostic_summary.py` reports "SUCCESS: Query execution is working!"
- [ ] NL2DAX application can execute queries against Power BI datasets

## üìù Lessons Learned

1. **Capacity Status Takes Precedence:** Even with perfect authentication and permissions, capacity accessibility is the critical factor
2. **Admin vs User API Discrepancies:** Capacity status can differ between admin and user APIs during transitions
3. **Query Language Independence:** 401 errors affect all query types equally when caused by capacity issues
4. **Comprehensive Testing Value:** Having multiple test approaches (DAX, SQL, REST API, XMLA) helps isolate issues quickly

**Final Note:** This comprehensive diagnostic suite will remain valuable for ongoing Power BI environment monitoring and troubleshooting. The tools created during this investigation provide a robust foundation for maintaining and debugging Power BI query execution in the future.
