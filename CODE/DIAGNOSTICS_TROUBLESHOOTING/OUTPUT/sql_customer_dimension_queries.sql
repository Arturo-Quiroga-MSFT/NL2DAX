USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
==================

1. COPY any query above
2. PASTE into SQL Server Management Studio, Azure Data Studio, or your SQL execution environment
3. EXECUTE to see the results
4. MODIFY search terms, countries, or other filters as needed

CONNECTION DETAILS:
==================
Server: aqsqlserver001.database.windows.net
Database: adventureworksdb
Authentication: Azure Active Directory

QUERY RECOMMENDATIONS:
=====================

üîç START WITH: Query 1 (customer keys and names) to verify basic connectivity
üìä OVERVIEW: Query 4 (summary statistics) to understand data volume
üåç GEOGRAPHY: Query 5 (by country) to see geographic distribution  
üè≠ INDUSTRY: Query 6 (by industry) to see sector breakdown
‚ö†Ô∏è  RISK: Query 7 (by risk rating) to see risk profile
üîé SEARCH: Query 8 or 9 to find specific customers
üìã SCHEMA: Query 11 to see table structure
üîç DATA QUALITY: Query 13 to check for missing data

EXPECTED RESULTS:
================

If your customer dimension is properly loaded:
‚úÖ Query 1 will show customer keys and names
‚úÖ Query 4 will show meaningful counts (not zero)
‚úÖ Query 5-7 will show distribution breakdowns
‚úÖ Query 8-10 will return filtered results based on criteria

If there are issues:
‚ùå "Invalid object name 'FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION'" = Table doesn't exist
‚ùå Empty results = No data loaded
‚ùå Column errors = Column names don't match your table structure
‚ùå Permission errors = Check database access rights

PERFORMANCE NOTES:
=================
- Use TOP clause for large tables to limit results
- Add WHERE clauses to filter data effectively
- Consider adding indexes on frequently queried columns
- Use appropriate data types for better performance
