# Shared Resources and Configuration

This directory contains shared configuration files, export utilities, and common resources used across multiple components of the NL2DAX project.

## Configuration Files

### Git Configuration
- **`.gitignore`** - Git ignore patterns for Python, VS Code, and project-specific files

## Export and Data Management

### Exports Directory
- **`EXPORTS/`** - Contains exported data, schemas, and generated files
  - Database schema exports
  - Query result exports
  - Configuration backups
  - Generated documentation

## Usage

### Git Configuration
The `.gitignore` file ensures sensitive and generated files are not committed:
- Environment variables (`.env` files)
- Python cache files (`__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`)
- IDE configuration files
- Generated logs and outputs
- Temporary files

### Export Management
The `EXPORTS/` directory serves as a central location for:
- **Schema Exports**: Database structure and metadata
- **Query Results**: Saved query outputs for analysis
- **Configuration Exports**: Backup of working configurations
- **Documentation**: Generated API documentation and guides

## Integration with Other Components

### NL2DAX Pipeline
- Uses shared configuration patterns
- Outputs results to EXPORTS/ directory
- Follows .gitignore patterns for security

### Database Setup
- Exports database schemas to EXPORTS/
- Uses shared configuration templates
- Maintains backup configurations

### Diagnostics and Troubleshooting
- Saves diagnostic reports to EXPORTS/
- Uses shared logging patterns
- Follows common file organization

### Legacy Examples
- References shared configuration approaches
- Uses common export patterns for results
- Maintains consistent file structure

## Best Practices

### Configuration Management
- Keep sensitive data out of version control
- Use environment variables for credentials
- Maintain configuration templates (.example files)
- Document configuration requirements

### Export Organization
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Include timestamps in export files
- Organize by component and date
- Maintain export retention policies

### File Management
- Regularly clean up temporary files
- Archive old exports when not needed
- Monitor disk space usage
- Implement backup strategies for important exports

## Security Considerations

### Sensitive Data
- Never commit `.env` files
- Review exports for sensitive information
- Use appropriate file permissions
- Implement data retention policies

### Access Control
- Restrict access to sensitive exports
- Use secure channels for sharing exports
- Audit export access regularly
- Implement export approval processes for production data
