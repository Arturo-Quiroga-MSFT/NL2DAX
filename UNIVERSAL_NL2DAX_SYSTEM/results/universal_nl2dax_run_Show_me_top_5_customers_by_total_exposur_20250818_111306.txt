SELECT TOP 5 
    c.CUSTOMER_ID AS CustomerID,
    COALESCE(c.CUSTOMER_NAME, 'Unknown') AS CustomerName,
    SUM(COALESCE(f.EXPOSURE_AT_DEFAULT, 0)) AS TotalExposure
FROM FIS_CA_DETAIL_FACT f
INNER JOIN FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION c
    ON f.CUSTOMER_KEY = c.CUSTOMER_KEY
GROUP BY 
    c.CUSTOMER_ID,
    c.CUSTOMER_NAME
ORDER BY 
    TotalExposure DESC
