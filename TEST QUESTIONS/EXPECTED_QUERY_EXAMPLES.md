## üéØ Key Query Patterns

### Common Joins Expected:
1. **Customer + Loans**: `FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION` ‚Üî `FIS_LOAN_PRODUCT_DIMENSION`
2. **Customer + Facilities**: `FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION` ‚Üî `FIS_CA_PRODUCT_DIMENSION`
3. **Multi-table Analysis**: All three tables joined for comprehensive views

### Expected Aggregations:
- **COUNT(*)**: Record counts
- **SUM()**: Financial amounts
- **AVG()**: Average calculations
- **MIN/MAX()**: Range analysis
- **DISTINCTCOUNT()**: Unique value counting

### Expected Filters:
- **Geographic**: Country filtering and grouping
- **Currency**: Multi-currency analysis
- **Date**: Maturity and origination filtering
- **Risk**: Customer risk rating analysis
- **Status**: Active vs inactive products

### Expected Calculations:
- **Utilization Rates**: (Commitment - Available) / Commitment
- **Risk Aggregations**: Average risk by geography
- **Currency Totals**: Sum amounts by currency
- **Diversification Metrics**: Count of distinct products/currencies
