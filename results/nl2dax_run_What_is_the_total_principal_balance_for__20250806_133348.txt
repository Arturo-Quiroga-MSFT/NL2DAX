NL Query: What is the total principal balance for each customer?
Generated DAX:
Here’s a plain‐DAX table‐expression that will give you, for each customer, the sum of PRINCIPAL_BALANCE. It assumes you have the one‐to‐many relationship between  
FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION[Customer_Key] → FIS_CL_DETAIL_FACT[Customer_Key] in your model.

EVALUATE  
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(  
    'FIS_Customer_Dimension'[Customer_ID],  
    'FIS_Customer_Dimension'[Customer_Name],  
    "Total Principal Balance",  
        SUM( 'FIS_CL_Detail_Fact'[Principal_Balance] )  
)  

ORDER BY  
    'FIS_Customer_Dimension'[Customer_Name]  

Explanation:  
• SUMMARIZECOLUMNS groups by the two customer columns.  
• The SUM(…) call computes the principal balance per customer.  
• EVALUATE / ORDER BY lets you run this as a DAX query in SSMS or DAX Studio.

Generated SQL:
Here’s a straightforward T-SQL that sums up the principal balance by customer, using the customer’s business‐key and name from your customer dimension:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.CUSTOMER_ID,
    c.CUSTOMER_NAME,
    SUM(f.PRINCIPAL_BALANCE) AS TotalPrincipalBalance
FROM dbo.FIS_CL_DETAIL_FACT   AS f
JOIN dbo.FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION AS c
  ON f.CUSTOMER_KEY = c.CUSTOMER_KEY
GROUP BY
    c.CUSTOMER_ID,
    c.CUSTOMER_NAME
ORDER BY
    TotalPrincipalBalance DESC;
```
