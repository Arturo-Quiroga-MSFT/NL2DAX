what are my outsstanding loand in my portfolio, and describe the customers for me

========== GENERATED SQL ==========
Below is one way to pull back every outstanding loan owned by “you” along with the key customer‐level attributes.  It assumes that your user‐name is stored in OWNER_NAME on the Owner‐dimension; if not, just hard‐code or pass in whatever string represents “me.”

```sql
-- Replace this with your actual “me” value or pass in as a parameter
DECLARE @OwnerName    NVARCHAR(100) = SUSER_SNAME();  

SELECT
    d.LOAN_ID,
    d.FACILITY_ID,
    d.AS_OF_DATE,
    d.CURRENT_PRINCIPAL_BALANCE,
    d.INTEREST_BALANCE,
    d.TOTAL_BALANCE,
    d.LOAN_STATUS,
    c.CUSTOMER_ID,
    c.CUSTOMER_NAME,
    c.INDUSTRY_DESCRIPTION,
    c.COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION,
    c.RISK_RATING_DESCRIPTION,
    c.RELATIONSHIP_MANAGER
FROM
    FIS_CL_DETAIL_FACT    AS d
    INNER JOIN FIS_OWNER_DIMENSION    AS o
        ON d.OWNER_KEY = o.OWNER_KEY
    INNER JOIN FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION AS c
        ON d.CUSTOMER_KEY = c.CUSTOMER_KEY
WHERE
    d.LOAN_STATUS = 'outstanding'      -- only outstanding loans
    AND o.OWNER_NAME = @OwnerName      -- only loans in “your” portfolio
ORDER BY
    c.CUSTOMER_NAME,
    d.AS_OF_DATE;
```

Explanation of joins and filters:  
• We start in the fact table (FIS_CL_DETAIL_FACT) where all loan‐level balances live.  
• We join to FIS_OWNER_DIMENSION to restrict to your portfolio (OWNER_NAME = ‘me’).  
• We then join to FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION to pull back customer details (name, industry, country, risk rating, relationship manager).  
• Finally we filter on LOAN_STATUS = 'outstanding' to get only active/outstanding loans.

========== SANITIZED SQL (FOR EXECUTION) ==========
-- Replace this with your actual "me" value or pass in as a parameter

    d.LOAN_ID,
    d.FACILITY_ID,
    d.AS_OF_DATE,
    d.CURRENT_PRINCIPAL_BALANCE,

    INNER JOIN FIS_OWNER_DIMENSION    AS o
        ON d.OWNER_KEY = o.OWNER_KEY
    INNER JOIN FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION AS c
        ON d.CUSTOMER_KEY = c.CUSTOMER_KEY
WHERE
    d.LOAN_STATUS = 'outstanding'      -- only outstanding loans
    AND o.OWNER_NAME = @OwnerName      -- only loans in "your" portfolio
ORDER BY
    c.CUSTOMER_NAME,
    d.AS_OF_DATE;

========== SQL QUERY RESULTS ==========
No results returned.

========== GENERATED DAX ==========
Here’s one way to build a DAX _query_ that:

 1. Filters your loan‐detail fact to only the “outstanding” loans  
 2. Filters again to only those loans whose Owner in FIS_OWNER_DIMENSION matches the current user (“me”)  
 3. Summarizes by customer, returning a count of outstanding loans plus the total outstanding principal per customer  
 4. Shows basic customer attributes (name, country) alongside those measures  

```DAX
EVALUATE
VAR _CurrentOwner = USERPRINCIPALNAME()
RETURN
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(
    -- Customer attributes you want to show
    FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION[CUSTOMER_KEY],
    FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION[CUSTOMER_NAME],
    FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION[COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION],

    -- Measure 1: number of distinct outstanding loans
    "OutstandingLoanCount",
        CALCULATE(
            DISTINCTCOUNT( FIS_CL_DETAIL_FACT[LOAN_ID] ),
            FIS_CL_DETAIL_FACT[LOAN_STATUS] = "outstanding",
            -- link back to Owner dimension and filter to current user
            TREATAS( { _CurrentOwner }, FIS_OWNER_DIMENSION[OWNER_NAME] )
        ),

    -- Measure 2: total current principal balance on those loans
    "OutstandingPrincipalBalance",
        CALCULATE(
            SUM( FIS_CL_DETAIL_FACT[CURRENT_PRINCIPAL_BALANCE] ),
            FIS_CL_DETAIL_FACT[LOAN_STATUS] = "outstanding",
            TREATAS( { _CurrentOwner }, FIS_OWNER_DIMENSION[OWNER_NAME] )
        )
)
ORDER BY
    [OutstandingPrincipalBalance] DESC
```

Explanation of key pieces:

• USERPRINCIPALNAME() captures the “me” logic in your portfolio_owner entity  
• TREATAS( { _CurrentOwner }, FIS_OWNER_DIMENSION[OWNER_NAME] ) applies that owner‐filter into the fact table via the model’s relationships  
• SUMMARIZECOLUMNS is used to project the set of customers plus two calculated measures  

You can add or remove customer columns, swap COUNTRY_DESCRIPTION for any other attribute, or switch to USERNAME() if that better matches how your security is wired.
