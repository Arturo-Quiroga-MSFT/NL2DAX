NL Query: What is the total principal balance for each customer?
Generated DAX:
Here’s a simple DAX table‐returning query that sums the principal balance by customer name. It assumes you have the standard relationship between FIS_CL_DETAIL_FACT[Customer_Key] → FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION[Customer_Key] in your model:

EVALUATE  
SUMMARIZECOLUMNS(  
    'FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION'[Customer_Name],  
    "Total Principal Balance",  
        SUM( 'FIS_CL_DETAIL_FACT'[Principal_Balance] )  
)  
ORDER BY  
    [Total Principal Balance] DESC  

If you prefer to group by Customer_ID instead of Customer_Name, just replace the first argument with  
  'FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION'[Customer_ID]  
(or include both as separate columns in SUMMARIZECOLUMNS).

Generated SQL:
Here’s a simple T-SQL that sums up the current principal balance by customer name. It joins the fact table to the customer dimension, groups by the customer, and returns the total principal balance per customer:

```sql
SELECT 
    c.CUSTOMER_ID,
    c.CUSTOMER_NAME,
    SUM(f.PRINCIPAL_BALANCE) AS TOTAL_PRINCIPAL_BALANCE
FROM 
    FIS_CL_DETAIL_FACT AS f
    INNER JOIN FIS_CUSTOMER_DIMENSION AS c
        ON f.CUSTOMER_KEY = c.CUSTOMER_KEY
GROUP BY
    c.CUSTOMER_ID,
    c.CUSTOMER_NAME
ORDER BY
    TOTAL_PRINCIPAL_BALANCE DESC;
```
Sanitized SQL (for execution):
