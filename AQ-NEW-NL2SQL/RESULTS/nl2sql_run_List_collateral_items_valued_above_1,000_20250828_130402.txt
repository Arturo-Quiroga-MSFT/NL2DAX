========== SQL GENERATION REASONING ==========
• Entities mapping  
  - “collateral items” → dbo.Collateral  
  - return fields “type” → CollateralType, “valuation_date” → ValuationDate  

• Tables/Joins  
  - Primary table: dbo.Collateral  
  - No additional joins needed for requested fields  

• Aggregations  
  - None  

• Filters  
  - ValueAmount > 1,000,000  
  - (Optional) Status = ‘Active’ if only current items are desired  

• Order/Limit  
  - Order by ValuationDate DESC  
  - (Optional) TOP N if limiting results  

• Assumptions  
  - Collateral records use CurrencyCode consistently  
  - No currency conversion required for ValueAmount filter  
  - All collateral types should be included unless status filter applied
